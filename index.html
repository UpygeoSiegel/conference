            <p class="card-text">I was born and raised in Inglewood, California, the son of immigrant parents from
              Mexico. I was a founding student of Green Dot Public Schools, University Prep's original founders. Though
              not always an easy road, I persevered through high school and attended college in Los Angeles at
              Occidental College and earned a degree in International Relations. In 2008 I made the decision to move to
              New York City to pursue a Masters degree at Teachers College and to help establish University Prep Charter
              High School (formerly Green Dot New York Charter High School) as a founding faculty member. I have been
              incredibly fortunate enough to be married to an amazing educator, business owner and professor and I am
              the proud father of 2 young daughters. They are without a doubt my reason for trying to bring my best
              everyday. Education has always been a part of my life even when I didn't realize it. My goal is to not
              just provide lessons within the classroom but for my students to walk away with life lessons that will
              benefit them once they leave University Prep. </p>

            <p class="card-text">Nathaniel Bouie is native of Rochester, NY and joins the UPrep family after eight years of teaching. He relocated to the NYC area in 2014 to expand his career and educational interests. In doing so, he taught a variety of subjects and coached varsity basketball, demonstrating an ability to lead among several schools in the northern sector of the Bronx.  Beyond education, his interests include learning, fitness and team sports of all kinds. 
            Mr. Bouie began his post secondary studies at Monroe Community College (Rochester, NY) and worked tirelessly to earn graduate honors. He would then move on to become a proud graduate of SUNY Cortland (Cortland, NY) and Mercy College (Bronx, NY) where he earned his undergraduate and graduate degrees. Mr. Bouie is currently a doctoral candidate at Pepperdine University (Malibu, CA).
            His commitment to urban education is driven by his own experiences and inspirations. Mr. Bouie uses his own life as evidence to support the idea that students of color from Impoverished urban communities can achieve. It is his unwavering belief in this idea that has allowed him to build meaningful relationships with students, parents and colleagues. When an opportunity was presented, Mr. Bouie excitedly joined the UPrep administration in 2020 as an Assistant Principal.

            <p class="card-text">Dumitru David Grigorean, or Mr G. as he’s fondly known to his students, is an energetic, proud, and enthusiastic University Prep Charter High School teacher. He was born and raised in Romania by his maternal grandparents. In 2007, when he was 14 years old, he moved to New York City. Adaptation to his new surroundings was tough. He did not speak the language, did not have any friends here, and was not familiar with American culture. He had to learn everything anew. He started his studies, at the time, classified as an English Language Learner, at Grover Cleveland High School in Ridgewood, Queens. He was blessed to come across some incredibly dedicated educators who offered their free time to work with him. With their help, he graduated as Salutatorian of his class. He continued his studies at Queens College, from which he graduated with a degree in Secondary Education and History, Summa Cum Laude. It was also at Queens College that Mr. G earned his master’s degree in history. In 2015, Mr. Grigorean joined Teach for America and was assigned to University Prep Charter High School where he began his teaching career. He is still there to this day. Mr. Grigorean is very passionate about teaching and is also an avid soccer fan. His favorite team is Chelsea F.C.</p>

            <p class="card-text">My name is David Tejada. I am a first year Spanish educator at University Prep Charter High School, located in the Bronx, NY. I graduated from Le Moyne College, in May of 2023, with a bachelor’s degree in Spanish Adolescent & TESOL Education. I am a first generation student that was born and raised in the Dominican Republic. I moved to the United States in 2012, when I was 11 years old. It is with pride I say that I have always been passionate about teaching. Growing up in the Dominican Republic there was nothing I wanted to do more than to become an educator. After I moved to the United States my eagerness to teach intensified. I now educate at the same high school that I graduated from. It fills my heart with joy, to know that I can make an impact in the same community that experienced my flourishment. UP was and continues to be an essential part to my professional development. I am happy to be here and happy to teach. </p>

            <p class="card-text">Here's a little about me. I am of mixed race (Jamaican and Irish) born and
            breed in the Bronx, NYC.   I have a BA in English from Baruch College.
            Presently I am a Program Director (ASPIRA NYC)  for GatorCorps/Later Gator programs at University Prep HS.  I am the Director for a student employment program (GatorCorps/employing over 125 students) & activity club program (Later Gator).  I have worked in the education sector for over 25yrs managing programs within higher education, elementary, early childhood and  middle school.  I’ve worked for various Community Based Organizations within my tenure.  Working with High School youth has by far been an extreme highlight.  

            My other interest vary, but physical fitness is a long time passion
            for me. Modeling falls perfectly in line with these interests.  Fitness has transformed me into a machine both physically & mentally.  It has given me strength and I'm determined to take it to the next level.  I enjoy challenging myself...pushing boundaries and the envelope.  It has definitely been a tough road and a struggle to get on the right path in order to stay consistent.  I am working on a self help book about body dysmorphia  (Solace & Concealed) a topic I can totally relate to.

            I have been modeling for over 10 years and have worked with some amazing
            creative photographers, designers and artists. I have graced the cover of
            BEAUTIFULMAG two times as well as been featured in DNA magazine several
            times.   I have published my very first modeling coffee book, Comfortable Being Uncomfortable  (Published, July 2, 2021).  I have been featured on a NYC Times Square Billboard (Times Square, NYC) for MarcMarlon NY (clothing brand).  I have been featured in several music videos, online blogs and INT'L books, including three of Bruno Gmunder's books.  I have also modeled in numerous Fashion Shows including shows for uber talented Larry Underwood (UNDERWOOD NY Designs) & CHULO Underwear to name a few.  Being multifaceted is what I’ve strived for and I feel I’ve accomplished what I sort out.

Which is what Carolina Luciano is, she serves as University Prep’s Operations Associate. She is always ready and willing to help those in need of a helping hand. Ms. Luciano has walked many paths in this lifetime. Luciano was once a babysitter, youth counselor, writer, baker, interior designer, events planner, a paraprofessional and a surgical assistant. Although she has walked many paths, there’s are still many more to explore.

            Ms. Luciano has an associates degree in liberal arts and a bachelor’s degree in Psychology. She’s very family oriented and there is nothing she won’t do for the people she loves, including her UP Family.

Peelen was a founding faculty advisor of the Peer Group Connection (PGC) program at UPCHS and discovered a passion for developing young leaders.  Her specific area of interest is teaching students about effective communication strategies and conflict resolution through direct, non-violent communication.  

            Srta. Peelen discovered her love for Spanish language and cultures while studying abroad in Spain and traveling throughout Perú, Costa Rica, Cuba and Puerto Rico.  Her one piece of advice for learning another language- LIVE THE LANGUAGE.  She is also a trained yoga instructor, 2 time NYC marathon finisher (and currently training for her 3rd maraton!) and dance enthusiast.  When she is not teaching, she is reading a good book, lounging with her dogs, cheering on her daughters at softball/tae kwon do tournaments, snacking or watching Gilmore Girls on Netflix (#TeamMarty).  She aspires to be a contestant on Dancing with The Stars, a published author of Spanish readers and be a part of a Broadway cast one day… 
            She is easily won over by a humble offering of dark chocolate, a smile and any song from the Hamilton or Hadestown soundtracks.
